# Web-Technologies - Assignment1
The idea behind this assignment and the next is to build a web site of your own choosing. The two assignments involve building a site structure consisting of several web pages, and adding illustrations and animation or interaction. The second assignment will add the server side issues such as computation and database storage.  This assignment is about client-side technologies, i.e. ones handled by the browser. That includes HTML for web pages, CSS for style, images created with painting and drawing tools such as Gimp and Inkscape, and stored in PNG or SVG format. It is also about animation using JavaScript.
